What is a Script?
	Programming with Web Page.

There are different script languages are exist.
		VBScript
		JavaScript
		ECMAScript  (Modified ECMAScript is ES5/ES6)

Purpose of Any Script Language is :
		1.  Creating Dynamic Web Pages
		2.  Validating web page inputs

What is a JavaScript:- 
	It is a Loosely Typed Script Lang which meant for Creating dynamic pages and Validating web 		page inputs at client side. 

	JavaScript is a Browser Independent Script Lang. 

1. Since it is Loosely Typed, it doesn't hava any data types to declare variables.
	variables are declared as follows
		var/let  <variable> = <value>
			or
		variable = value
2. To Write Script program we have to use Html Program UI, within that following tag has to be used
	to write script code
	<script  type="text/javascript">
			script code
	</script>
	Note :-  this tag has to present at the end of  <body> tag. 
3.  To print some thing on the browser, use following statement
		document.write/writeln("stmt"/variable);

		here "document" is an object, which represents currently working web page. 
	
	What is a DOM? 
			It is a "Document Object Model", it consist collection methods to perform 
			different kinds of actions. 
			every method can be accessed with an object.

4.   Script is a Function based language, so that every task has to defined with in  a function. 
		here it is how to create a function
			function <fun_name>([arg])
			{
				code
			}
		Once function is defined, call that function
			<fun_name>([arg values])

5.  Any GUI programming is Event Driven Programing. So that An Event is, Action oriented method executed by performing another action. 
		Click		:- it is used for button, here event name is "onclick" 		
		DoubleClick	:- it is also used for button, event name is "ondblclick"
		Change		:- it is used for radiobutton, dropdownlist, checkbox, 
							event name  "onchange"
		Load		:- it is used to perform any action when web page is loading(body)
					event name :  "onload"
		Submit
		KeyPress
		KeyUp
		KeyDown
		DraganDrop
6.  All Web Page input tools should be enclosed within the <form> tag. 
		<form  name="name of form"  method="POST/GET"  action="Pagename">
			
		</form>
	Note :-  to get/set value from any tool, we have to use following syntax
				to set :   formname.toolname.value = <value>
				to get :   variable = formname.toolname.value
7.  To identify any html element / tag with "ID" property 
		document.getElementById("id prop name")
	It has two properties
			innerText :-  it allows to print any statement in text format.
			innerHTML :-  it allows to print any statement in html format.

8.  To Create an array :
		var <variablename> = [val1, val2, ....]

9. there are two function to convert values from string to numbers 
		parseInt(str) :-  integer
		parseFloat(str) :-  decimal
