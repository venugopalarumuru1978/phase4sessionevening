Today's Agenda :- 
-----------------
1.  TypeScript
2.  Angular
----------------------
What is an TypeScript?

It is a programming language which is developed by using JavaScript. 

TypeScript =  JavaScript + Additional Features

Additional Features:- 
--------------------
1. Data Types
2. OOPS Concepts
3. Modules(packages)
4. Misc Concepts 
	a. Arrow Functions
	b. String Interpolation
	c. Mulitline Strings

Purpose of TypeScript,  While Developing angular application, it uses TypeScript. 

TypeScript programs cannot be implemented in web page directly, so that every typescript program has to convert  in javascript, then that js code can be implemented in web page. 

TypeScript Program  ==> Compiler  ==> JavaScript Code  ==> Run  ==> Output.

For Software Installation Process

What is an NPM ?
	Full Form :  Node Package Manager Installer.
	It is a World Largest Software Library for any kind of frontend programming lang. 
			TypeScript
			Angular
			React JS
			Express JS
			Node JS
			Vue JS
	It has nearly 8 lakhs packages within it. 
	It is an Open Source Library(freely can use it).
	To Install NPM, we have to install "Node JS".
		Goto http://nodejs.org, download latest/specific version nodejs then install it.
	Once Node js is Installed, then we can install TypeScript as follows

		1.  Goto command prompt
		2.  use the following command to install typescript
			npm  install  typescript  -g

How to write TypeScript Program :- 

1.  Open any editor(VSCode)
2.  Code the program and save that program with .ts extension
3.  Now goto command prompt, then following command to compile
		tsc  filename.ts
4.  once it compiled successfully, it generate javascript code
		now run the program with following command
		node filename.js
--------------------------------------------------
Data types :- 

1.  number :-  it is for both integers/decimal values
2.  string :-  for strings
3.  boolean :-  for true/false
4.  any :-  for any type value

	var  <variable> : <data type>= <value>;
------------------
OOPS Concepts :- 

class <classname>
{
	variables declarations
	
	methodname([arg]) :  <return type>
	{
		code for the method.
	}
	....
}
note 1:-  while declaring variables inside the class, var/let should not use.
note 2:-  the variable declared inside the class can be access in the methods with the hlep of "this" 		keyword.
				this.variable
Object Creation :- 
	
	var/let Object = new ClassName([arg]);

TypeScript allows access specifiers also: private, public, protected

To create a constructor in typescript, use "constructor" keyword as follows

class <classname>
{

	constructor([args])
	{
		......
	}
}

Inheritance :- 

to inherit  parent class to the child class "extends" keyword
to inherit  interface to the class "implements" keyword.
--------------

As per TypeScript, No polymarphisum

---------------
What is a Module? 

It is the process of creating packages using typescript, i.e. using one class objects into another class. 

whenever we want's use one class into another class, that class create with "export" keyword

export  class <classname>
{
	....
}

once export class is defined, that can be imported into another class as follows

import { Classname }  from './filename';
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is an angular? 

It is an client-side web framework used to create web applications. 

By using Angular, We can create SPA(Single Page Application) based web applications. 

SPA :- One web page manages all other web pages within the web application/web site.
		It will avoid re-loading the entire web page when we are working with some porton of 		the web page. based on this process performance of the application will be improved. 

Angular is cross - platform framework. so that it works in all the OS's. 
To develop application using angular, typescript lang need. 

How to install angular software

1.  Install Node JS
2.  Install TypeScript
3.  Install Angular as follows
		a. goto command prompt then use following command
			npm  install @angular/cli -g  == it will install latest version

			npm  install @angular/cli@10.2.0 -g == it will install specific version
------------------------------
How to create an angular application
	a.  Goto Command Prompt
	b.  use following command to create angular application
			ng new <application_name>

To Run  the application :- 
		"ng serve" command has to be used at command prompt.

to stop the application, Ctrl+C is used
-------------------------------
What is a component? 
		It is a  building block of the angular app, which consist of following files
				html file == for UI
				css file == for styles
				ts  file == for scripting
				spec.ts file = for testing
when we create a new application, it create one component called as "App" component. it is also called as root component. 

How to create a componenet
		ng generate component  <comp name>
				or
		ng g component  <comp name>
-------------------------
Data Bindings :-  it is the relation b/w template(html file) and script(ts code).

it can be done in 4 ways

1. Interpolation
2. Property Binding
3. Event Binding
4. Two _ Way Binding

Interpolation :-  It is the process of the how to show a varible value into template
			{{variable }}

Event  Binding :-  it is the process adding event to the tools(button, radiobutton, ...)
			<tag (eventname) = "method()" ... />

			<input type="button"  value="click me"  onclick="m()" />  as per JS
		<input type="button"  value="click me"  (click)="m()" /> => as per ANgular
